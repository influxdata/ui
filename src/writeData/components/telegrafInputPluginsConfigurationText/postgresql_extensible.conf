# Read metrics from one or many postgresql servers
[[inputs.postgresql_extensible]]
  ## specify address via a url matching:
  ##   postgres://[pqgotest[:password]]@localhost[/dbname]\
  ##       ?sslmode=[disable|verify-ca|verify-full]
  ## or a simple string:
  ##   host=localhost user=pqgotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
  #
  ## All connection parameters are optional.  #
  ## Without the dbname parameter, the driver will default to a database
  ## with the same name as the user. This dbname is just for instantiating a
  ## connection with the server and doesn't restrict the databases we are trying
  ## to grab metrics for.
  #
  address = "host=localhost user=postgres sslmode=disable"

  ## connection configuration.
  ## maxlifetime - specify the maximum lifetime of a connection.
  ## default is forever (0s)
  max_lifetime = "0s"

  ## Whether to use prepared statements when connecting to the database.
  ## This should be set to false when connecting through a PgBouncer instance
  ## with pool_mode set to transaction.
  # prepared_statements = true

  ## A list of databases to pull metrics about. If not specified, metrics for all
  ## databases are gathered.
  ## databases = ["app_production", "testing"]
  #
  ## A custom name for the database that will be used as the "server" tag in the
  ## measurement output. If not specified, a default one generated from
  ## the connection address is used.
  # outputaddress = "db01"
  #
  ## Define the toml config where the sql queries are stored
  ## New queries can be added, if the withdbname is set to true and there is no
  ## databases defined in the 'databases field', the sql query is ended by a
  ## 'is not null' in order to make the query succeed.
  ## Example :
  ## The sqlquery : "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database where datname" become
  ## "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_database where datname IN ('postgres', 'pgbench')"
  ## because the databases variable was set to ['postgres', 'pgbench' ] and the
  ## withdbname was true. Be careful that if the withdbname is set to false you
  ## don't have to define the where clause (aka with the dbname) the tagvalue
  ## field is used to define custom tags (separated by commas)
  ## The optional "measurement" value can be used to override the default
  ## output measurement name ("postgresql").
  ##
  ## The script option can be used to specify the .sql file path.
  ## If script and sqlquery options specified at same time, sqlquery will be used
  ##
  ## the tagvalue field is used to define custom tags (separated by comas).
  ## the query is expected to return columns which match the names of the
  ## defined tags. The values in these columns must be of a string-type,
  ## a number-type or a blob-type.
  ##
  ## The timestamp field is used to override the data points timestamp value. By
  ## default, all rows inserted with current time. By setting a timestamp column,
  ## the row will be inserted with that column's value.
