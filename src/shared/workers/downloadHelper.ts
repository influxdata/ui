    Background:
        * the traditional approaches to file downloads will load the data first into browser memory.
        * this includes:
            * reading the response.body ReadableStream
            * converting to a file Blob
        * there is a web API for FileSystem writes, but it's not implemented for Firefox.
            * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API/Firefox_support
            * Firefox focused on uploadable streams from the fs. The result == firefox's web API does not support our use case.

    In order to trigger a direct to filesystem download, bypassing the browser memory, we needed:
        * have a response header:
            * `Content-Disposition`
            * which the server attaches in response to a request header `Prefer: return-download`
        * have a form submission request:
            * the XMLhttpRequest does not directly download, even with the appropriate header.
            * cannot use the `a` tag download feature, as that is only GET requests
            * a form submit is build into the browser to allow downloads. **this is the only approach**

    To get the form submit to have a http request which looked like our normal query requests:
        * we used a service worker, which can be an interceptor/listener for form submissions.
            * forms themselves do not allow headers to be attached.
        * then modify the headers, and parse the body to the appropriate format
