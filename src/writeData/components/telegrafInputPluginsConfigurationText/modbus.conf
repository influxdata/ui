# Retrieve data from MODBUS slave devices
[[inputs.modbus]]
  ## Connection Configuration
  ##
  ## The plugin supports connections to PLCs via MODBUS/TCP, RTU over TCP, ASCII over TCP or
  ## via serial line communication in binary (RTU) or readable (ASCII) encoding
  ##
  ## Device name
  name = "Device"

  ## Slave ID - addresses a MODBUS device on the bus
  ## Range: 0 - 255 [0 = broadcast; 248 - 255 = reserved]
  slave_id = 1

  ## Timeout for each request
  timeout = "1s"

  ## Maximum number of retries and the time to wait between retries
  ## when a slave-device is busy.
  # busy_retries = 0
  # busy_retries_wait = "100ms"

  # TCP - connect via Modbus/TCP
  controller = "tcp://localhost:502"

  ## Serial (RS485; RS232)
  ## For RS485 specific setting check the end of the configuration.
  ## For unix-like operating systems use:
  # controller = "file:///dev/ttyUSB0"
  ## For Windows operating systems use:
  # controller = "COM1"
  # baud_rate = 9600
  # data_bits = 8
  # parity = "N"
  # stop_bits = 1

  ## Transmission mode for Modbus packets depending on the controller type.
  ## For Modbus over TCP you can choose between "TCP" , "RTUoverTCP" and
  ## "ASCIIoverTCP".
  ## For Serial controllers you can choose between "RTU" and "ASCII".
  ## By default this is set to "auto" selecting "TCP" for ModbusTCP connections
  ## and "RTU" for serial connections.
  # transmission_mode = "auto"

  ## Trace the connection to the modbus device
  # log_level = "trace"

  ## Define the configuration schema
  ##  |---register -- define fields per register type in the original style (only supports one slave ID)
  ##  |---request  -- define fields on a requests base
  ##  |---metric   -- define fields on a metric base
  configuration_type = "register"

  ## Exclude the register type tag
  ## Please note, this will also influence the grouping of metrics as you won't
  ## see one metric per register type anymore!
