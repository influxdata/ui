      <h1>Execute a SQL Query</h1>
      <p>
        Now let's query the data we wrote into the database with SQL. Here is
        what our query looks like on its own:
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet
        language="sql"
        onCopy={logCopyCodeSnippet}
        showCopyControl={false}
        text={sqlSnippet}
      />
      <p>
        In this query, we are looking for data points within the last 1 hour
        with a "census" measurement and either "bees" or "ants" fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's use that SQL query in our Python code to show us the results of
        what we have written. We'll use pandas to format the results into a
        table.
      </p>
      <p>Run the following:</p>
      <CodeSnippet language="python" onCopy={logCopyCodeSnippet} text={query} />
      <p>
        The code snippet above should print out the data you wrote in previous
        steps. The result should resemble this:
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet
        language="text"
        onCopy={logCopyCodeSnippet}
        showCopyControl={false}
        text={queryPreview}
      />
    </>
  )
}
