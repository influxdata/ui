# This script is used to re-create the release for the pre-built UI assets
# for the OSS Master release. It will build the UI assets, add them to a tar,
# and upload them to the release, deleting the previous release of the same name
# in the process.
#
# This script should be run from the root of the repository. It requires
# having a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable set. You also need go, yarn and ghr.
#
# If you have go, you can install ghr by running:
#   GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/tcnksm/ghr@v0.13.0
